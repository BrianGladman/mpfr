@chapter Introduction to MPFR


MPFR is a portable library written in C for arbitrary precision arithmetic
on floating-point numbers. It is based on the GNU MP library.
It aims to extend the class of floating-point numbers provided by the
GNU MP library by a precise semantics. The main differences
with the @code{mpf} class from GNU MP are:

@itemize @bullet
@item the @code{mpfr} code is portable, i.e.@: the result of any operation
does not depend (or should not) on the machine word size
@code{mp_bits_per_limb} (32 or 64 on most machines);
@item the precision in bits can be set exactly to any valid value
for each variable (including very small precision);
@item @code{mpfr} provides the four rounding modes from the IEEE 754-1985
standard.
@end itemize

In particular, with a precision of 53 bits, @code{mpfr} should be able
to exactly reproduce all computations with double-precision machine
floating-point
numbers (@code{double} type in C), except the default exponent range
is much wider and subnormal numbers are not implemented but can be emulated.

This version of MPFR is released under the GNU Lesser General Public
License.
It is permitted to link MPFR to non-free programs, as long as when
distributing them the MPFR source code and a means to re-link with a
modified MPFR library is provided.

@section How to use this Manual

Everyone should read @ref{MPFR Basics}.  If you need to install the library
yourself, you need to read @ref{Installing MPFR}, too.

The rest of the manual can be used for later reference, although it is
probably a good idea to glance through it.

@chapter Installing MPFR
@cindex Installation

@section How to install

Here are the steps needed to install the library on Unix systems
(more details are provided in the @file{INSTALL} file):

@enumerate
@item
To build MPFR, you first have to install GNU MP
(version 4.1 or higher) on your computer.
You need a C compiler, preferably GCC, but any reasonable compiler should
work.  And you need a standard Unix @samp{make} program, plus some other
standard Unix utility programs.

@item
In the MPFR build directory, type
@samp{./configure}

This will prepare the build and setup the options according to your system.
If you get error messages, you might check that you use the same compiler
and compile options as for GNU MP (see the @file{INSTALL} file).

@item
@samp{make}

This will compile MPFR, and create a library archive file @file{libmpfr.a}.
A dynamic library may be produced too (see configure).

@item
@samp{make check}

This will make sure MPFR was built correctly.
If you get error messages, please
report this to @samp{mpfr@@loria.fr}.  (@xref{Reporting Bugs}, for
information on what to include in useful bug reports.)

@item
@samp{make install}

This will copy the files @file{mpfr.h} and @file{mpf2mpfr.h} to the directory
@file{/usr/local/include}, the file @file{libmpfr.a} to the directory
@file{/usr/local/lib}, and the file @file{mpfr.info} to the directory
@file{/usr/local/info} (or if you passed the @samp{--prefix} option to
 @file{configure}, using the prefix directory given as argument to
@samp{--prefix} instead of @file{/usr/local}).
@end enumerate

@section Other make targets

There are some other useful make targets:

@itemize @bullet
@item
@samp{mpfr.info} or @samp{info}

Create an info version of the manual, in @file{mpfr.info}.

@item
@samp{mpfr.dvi} or @samp{dvi}

Create a DVI version of the manual, in @file{mpfr.dvi}.

@item
@samp{mpfr.ps}

Create a Postscript version of the manual, in @file{mpfr.ps}.

@c @item
@c @samp{html}
@c Create a HTML version of the manual, in @file{mpfr.html}.

@item
@samp{clean}

Delete all object files and archive files, but not the configuration files.

@item
@samp{distclean}

Delete all files not included in the distribution.

@item
@samp{uninstall}

Delete all files copied by @samp{make install}.
@end itemize


@section Known Build Problems

MPFR suffers from all bugs from the GNU MP library, plus many more.

Please report other problems to @samp{mpfr@@loria.fr}.
@xref{Reporting Bugs}.
Some bug fixes are available on the MPFR web page
@url{http://www.mpfr.org/}.

@section Getting the Latest Version of MPFR

@chapter Reporting Bugs
@cindex Reporting bugs

If you think you have found a bug in the MPFR library, first have a look on the
MPFR web page @url{http://www.mpfr.org/}: perhaps this bug is already known,
in which case you may find there a workaround for it.
Otherwise, please investigate
and report it. We have made this library available to you, and it is not to ask
too much from you, to ask you to report the bugs that you find.

There are a few things you should think about when you put your bug report
together.

You have to send us a test case that makes it possible for us to reproduce the
bug.  Include instructions on how to run the test case.

You also have to explain what is wrong; if you get a crash, or if the results
printed are incorrect and in that case, in what way.

Please include compiler version information in your bug report. This can
be extracted using @samp{cc -V} on some machines, or, if you're using gcc,
@samp{gcc -v}. Also, include the output from @samp{uname -a} and the MPFR
version (the GMP version may be useful too).

If your bug report is good, we will do our best to help you to get a corrected
version of the library; if the bug report is poor, we won't do anything about
it (aside of chiding you to send better bug reports).

Send your bug report to: @samp{mpfr@@loria.fr}.

If you think something in this manual is unclear, or downright incorrect, or if
the language needs to be improved, please send a note to the same address.

@cindex @file{mpfr.h}
All declarations needed to use MPFR are collected in the include file
@file{mpfr.h}.  It is designed to work with both C and C++ compilers.
You should include that file in any program using the MPFR library:
@verbatim
#include <mpfr.h>
@end verbatim

@section Nomenclature and Types

@cindex Floating-point number
@tindex @code{mpfr_t}
@noindent
A @dfn{floating-point number} or @dfn{float} for short, is an arbitrary
precision mantissa with a limited precision exponent. The C data type
for such objects is @code{mpfr_t}. A floating-point number can have
three special values: Not-a-Number (NaN) or plus or minus Infinity. NaN
represents an uninitialized object, the result of an invalid operation
(like 0 divided by 0), or a value that cannot be determined (like
+Infinity minus +Infinity). Moreover, like in the IEEE 754-1985 standard,
zero is signed, i.e.@: there are both +0 and @minus{}0; the behavior
is the same as in the IEEE 754-1985 standard and it is generalized to
the other functions supported by MPFR.


@cindex Precision
@tindex @code{mp_prec_t}
@noindent
The @dfn{precision} is the number of bits used to represent the mantissa
of a floating-point number;
the corresponding C data type is @code{mp_prec_t}.
The precision can be any integer between @code{MPFR_PREC_MIN} and
@code{MPFR_PREC_MAX}. In the current implementation, @code{MPFR_PREC_MIN}
is equal to 2.

@cindex Rounding Modes
@tindex @code{mp_rnd_t}
@noindent
The @dfn{rounding mode} specifies the way to round the result of a
floating-point operation, in case the exact result can not be represented
exactly in the destination mantissa;
the corresponding C data type is @code{mp_rnd_t}.

@cindex Limb
@c @tindex @code{mp_limb_t}
@noindent
A @dfn{limb} means the part of a multi-precision number that fits in a single
word.  (We chose this word because a limb of the human body is analogous to a
digit, only larger, and containing several digits.)  Normally a limb contains
32 or 64 bits.  The C data type for a limb is @code{mp_limb_t}.

@section Function Classes

There is only one class of functions in the MPFR library:

@enumerate
@item
Functions for floating-point arithmetic, with names beginning with
@code{mpfr_}.  The associated type is @code{mpfr_t}.
@end enumerate


@section MPFR Variable Conventions

As a general rule, all MPFR functions expect output arguments before input
arguments.  This notation is based on an analogy with the assignment operator.

MPFR allows you to use the same variable for both input and output in the same
expression.  For example, the main function for floating-point multiplication,
@code{mpfr_mul}, can be used like this: @code{mpfr_mul (x, x, x, rnd_mode)}.
This
computes the square of @var{x} with rounding mode @code{rnd_mode}
and puts the result back in @var{x}.

Before you can assign to an MPFR variable, you need to initialize it by calling
one of the special initialization functions.  When you're done with a
variable, you need to clear it out, using one of the functions for that
purpose.

A variable should only be initialized once, or at least cleared out between
each initialization.  After a variable has been initialized, it may be
assigned to any number of times.

For efficiency reasons, avoid to initialize and clear out a variable in loops.
Instead, initialize it before entering the loop, and clear it out after the
loop has exited.

You don't need to be concerned about allocating additional space for MPFR
variables, since any variable has a mantissa of fixed size.
Hence unless you change its precision, or clear and reinitialize it,
a floating-point variable will have the same allocated space during all its
life.

@section Rounding modes

The following four rounding modes are supported:

@itemize @bullet
@item @code{GMP_RNDN}: round to nearest
@item @code{GMP_RNDZ}: round towards zero
@item @code{GMP_RNDU}: round towards plus infinity
@item @code{GMP_RNDD}: round towards minus infinity
@end itemize

The @samp{round to nearest} mode works as in the IEEE 754-1985 standard: in
case the number to be rounded lies exactly in the middle of two representable
numbers, it is rounded to the one with the least significant bit set to zero.
For example, the number 5/2, which is represented by (10.1) in binary, is
rounded to (10.0)=2 with a precision of two bits, and not to (11.0)=3.
This rule avoids the @dfn{drift} phenomenon mentioned by Knuth in volume 2
of The Art of Computer Programming (Section 4.2.2).

Most MPFR functions take as first argument the destination variable, as
second and following arguments the input variables, as last argument a
rounding mode, and have a return value of type @code{int}, called the
@dfn{ternary value}. The value stored in the destination variable is
correctly rounded, i.e.@: MPFR behaves as if it computed the result with
an infinite precision, then rounded it to the precision of this variable.
The input variables are regarded as exact (in particular, their precision
does not affect the result).

As a consequence, in case of a non-zero real rounded result, the error
on the result is less or equal to 1/2 ulp (unit in the last place) of
the target in the rounding to nearest mode, and less than 1 ulp of the
target in the directed rounding modes (a ulp is the weight of the least
significant represented bit of the target after rounding).
@c Since subnormals are not supported, we must take into account the ulp of
@c the rounded result, not the one of the exact result, for full generality.

Unless documented otherwise, functions returning an @code{int} return
a ternary value.
If the ternary value is zero, it means that the value stored in the
destination variable is the exact result of the corresponding mathematical
function. If the ternary value is positive (resp.@: negative), it means
the value stored in the destination variable is greater (resp.@: lower)
than the exact result. For example with the @code{GMP_RNDU} rounding mode,
the ternary value is usually positive, except when the result is exact, in
which case it is zero. In the case of an infinite result, it is considered
as inexact when it was obtained by overflow, and exact otherwise. A NaN
result (Not-a-Number) always corresponds to an exact return value.
The opposite of a returned ternary value is guaranteed to be representable
in an @code{int}.

Unless documented otherwise, functions returning a @code{1}
(or any other value specified in this manual)
for special cases (like @code{acos(0)}) should return an overflow or
an underflow if @code{1} is not representable in the current exponent range.

@node MPFR Interface, Contributors, MPFR Basics, Top
@comment  node-name,  next,  previous,  up
@chapter MPFR Interface
@cindex Floating-point functions
@cindex Float functions

The floating-point functions expect arguments of type @code{mpfr_t}.

The MPFR floating-point functions have an interface that is similar to the
GNU MP
integer functions.  The function prefix for floating-point operations is
@code{mpfr_}.

There is one significant characteristic of floating-point numbers that has
motivated a difference between this function class and other GNU MP function
classes: the inherent inexactness of floating-point arithmetic.  The user has
to specify the precision for each variable.  A computation that assigns a
variable will take place with the precision of the assigned variable; the
cost of that computation should not depend from the
precision of variables used as input (on average).

@cindex Precision
The semantics of a calculation in MPFR is specified as follows: Compute the
requested operation exactly (with ``infinite accuracy''), and round the result
to the precision of the destination variable, with the given rounding mode.
The MPFR floating-point functions are intended to be a smooth extension
of the IEEE 754-1985 arithmetic. The results obtained on one computer should
not differ from the results obtained on a computer with a different word size.

@cindex Accuracy
MPFR does not keep track of the accuracy of a computation. This is left
to the user or to a higher layer.
As a consequence, if two variables are used to store
only a few significant bits, and their product is stored in a variable with large
precision, then MPFR will still compute the result with full precision.

The value of errno may be set to non-zero by any MPFR function or macro,
whether or not there is an error.

@cindex Initialization functions
@section Initialization Functions

An @code{mpfr_t} object must be initialized before storing the first value in
it.  The functions @code{mpfr_init} and @code{mpfr_init2} are used for that
purpose.

@deftypefun void mpfr_init2 (mpfr_t @var{x}, mp_prec_t @var{prec})
Initialize @var{x}, set its precision to be @strong{exactly}
@var{prec} bits and its value to NaN. (Warning: the corresponding
@code{mpf} functions initialize to zero instead.)

Normally, a variable should be initialized once only or at
least be cleared, using @code{mpfr_clear}, between initializations.
To change the precision of a variable which has already been initialized,
use @code{mpfr_set_prec}.
The precision @var{prec} must be an integer between @code{MPFR_PREC_MIN} and
@code{MPFR_PREC_MAX} (otherwise the behavior is undefined).
@end deftypefun

@deftypefun void mpfr_clear (mpfr_t @var{x})
Free the space occupied by @var{x}.  Make sure to call this function for all
@code{mpfr_t} variables when you are done with them.
@end deftypefun

@deftypefun void mpfr_init (mpfr_t @var{x})
Initialize @var{x} and set its value to NaN.

Normally, a variable should be initialized once only
or at least be cleared, using @code{mpfr_clear}, between initializations.  The
precision of @var{x} is the default precision, which can be changed
by a call to @code{mpfr_set_default_prec}.
@end deftypefun

@deftypefun void mpfr_set_default_prec (mp_prec_t @var{prec})
Set the default precision to be @strong{exactly} @var{prec} bits.  The
precision of a variable means the number of bits used to store its mantissa.
All
subsequent calls to @code{mpfr_init} will use this precision, but previously
initialized variables are unaffected.
This default precision is set to 53 bits initially.
The precision can be any integer between @code{MPFR_PREC_MIN} and
@code{MPFR_PREC_MAX}.
@end deftypefun

@deftypefun mp_prec_t mpfr_get_default_prec (void)
Return the default MPFR precision in bits.
@end deftypefun

@need 2000
Here is an example on how to initialize floating-point variables:

@example
@{
  mpfr_t x, y;
  mpfr_init (x);			/* use default precision */
  mpfr_init2 (y, 256);		/* precision @emph{exactly} 256 bits */
  @dots{}
  /* When the program is about to exit, do ... */
  mpfr_clear (x);
  mpfr_clear (y);
@}
@end example

The following functions are useful for changing the precision during a
calculation.  A typical use would be for adjusting the precision gradually in
iterative algorithms like Newton-Raphson, making the computation precision
closely match the actual accurate part of the numbers.

@deftypefun void mpfr_set_prec (mpfr_t @var{x}, mp_prec_t @var{prec})
Reset the precision of @var{x} to be @strong{exactly} @var{prec} bits,
and set its value to NaN.
The previous value stored in @var{x} is lost. It is equivalent to
a call to @code{mpfr_clear(x)} followed by a call to
@code{mpfr_init2(x, prec)}, but more efficient as no allocation is done in
case the current allocated space for the mantissa of @var{x} is enough.
The precision @var{prec} can be any integer between @code{MPFR_PREC_MIN} and
@code{MPFR_PREC_MAX}.

In case you want to keep the previous value stored in @var{x},
use @code{mpfr_prec_round} instead.
@end deftypefun

@deftypefun mp_prec_t mpfr_get_prec (mpfr_t @var{x})
Return the precision actually used for assignments of @var{x}, i.e.@: the
number of bits used to store its mantissa.
@end deftypefun

If the system doesn't support the IEEE-754 standard, @code{mpfr_set_d},
@code{mpfr_set_decimal64} and
@code{mpfr_set_ld} might not preserve the signed zeros.
The @code{mpfr_set_decimal64} function is built only with the configure
option @code{--enable-decimal-float}, and when the compiler or
system provides the @code{_Decimal64} data type.
@code{mpfr_set_q} might not be able to work if the numerator (or the
denominator) can not be representable as a @code{mpfr_t}.

Note: If you want to store a floating-point constant to a @code{mpfr_t},
you should use @code{mpfr_set_str} (or one of the MPFR constant functions,
such as @code{mpfr_const_pi} for @m{\pi,Pi}) instead of @code{mpfr_set_d},
@code{mpfr_set_decimal64} 
or @code{mpfr_set_ld}. Otherwise the floating-point constant will be first
converted into a reduced-precision (e.g., 53-bit) binary number before
MPFR can work with it.

Set the value of @var{rop} from @m{@var{op} \times 2^e, @var{op} multiplied by
two to the power @var{e}}, rounded towards the given direction @var{rnd}.

@end deftypefun

@deftypefun int mpfr_set_str (mpfr_t @var{rop}, const char *@var{s}, int @var{base}, mp_rnd_t @var{rnd})
Set @var{rop} to the value of the whole string @var{s} in base @var{base},
rounded in the direction @var{rnd}.
See the documentation of @code{mpfr_strtofr} for a detailed description
of the valid string formats.
@c Additionally, special values
@c @code{@@NaN@@}, @code{@@Inf@@}, @code{+@@Inf@@} and @code{-@@Inf@@},
@c all case insensitive, without leading whitespace and possibly followed by
@c other characters, are accepted too (it may change).
This function returns 0 if the entire string up to the final null character
is a valid number in base @var{base}; otherwise it returns @minus{}1, and
@var{rop} may have changed.
@end deftypefun

@deftypefun int mpfr_strtofr (mpfr_t @var{rop}, const char *@var{nptr}, char **@var{endptr}, int @var{base}, mp_rnd_t @var{rnd})

Read a floating-point number from a string @var{nptr} in base @var{base},
rounded in the direction @var{rnd}. If successful, the
result is stored in @var{rop} and @code{*@var{endptr}} points to the
character just after those parsed. If @var{str} doesn't start with a
valid number then @var{rop} is set to zero and the value of @var{nptr}
is stored in the location referenced by @var{endptr}.

Parsing follows the standard C @code{strtod} function. This means optional
leading whitespace, an optional @code{+} or @code{-}, mantissa digits with
an optional decimal point, and an
optional exponent consisting of an @code{e} or @code{E} (if
@math{@var{base} @le{} 10}) or @code{@@}, an optional sign, and digits.
The decimal point can be either the one defined by the current locale or
the period (the first one is accepted for consistency with the C standard
and the practice, the second one is accepted to allow the programmer to
provide MPFR numbers from strings in a way that does not depend on the
current locale).
A hexadecimal mantissa can be given with a leading @code{0x} or @code{0X}, in
which case @code{p} or @code{P} may introduce an optional binary exponent,
indicating the power of 2 by which the mantissa is to be scaled. A binary
mantissa can be given with a leading @code{0b} or @code{0B}, in which case
@code{e}, @code{E}, @code{p}, @code{P} or @code{@@} may introduce the
binary exponent. The exponent is always written in base 10.

In addition, @code{infinity}, @code{inf} (if @math{@var{base} @le{} 10})
or @code{@@inf@@} with an optional sign, or @code{nan},
@code{nan(n-char-sequence)} (if @math{@var{base} @le{} 10}), @code{@@nan@@}
or @code{@@nan@@(n-char-sequence)} all case insensitive (as Latin letters),
can be given. A @code{n-char-sequence} is a non-empty string containing
only digits, Latin letters and the underscore (0, 1, 2, ..., 9, a, b, ...,
z, A, B, ..., Z, _).

There must be at least one digit in the mantissa for the number to
be valid. If an exponent has no digits it's ignored and parsing
stops after the mantissa. If an @code{0x}, @code{0X}, @code{0b} or
@code{0B} is not followed by hexadecimal/binary digits, parsing stops
after the first @code{0}:
the subject sequence is defined as the longest initial
subsequence of the input string, starting with the first
non-white-space character, that is of the expected form.
The subject sequence contains no characters if the input
string is not of the expected form.

Note that in the hex format the exponent @code{P} represents a power of 2,
whereas @code{@@} represents a power of the base (i.e. 16).

If the argument @var{base} is different from 0, it must be in the range 2
to 36.
@c For bases up to 36,
Case is ignored; uppercase and lowercase letters have the same
value.
@c ; for bases 37 to 62, uppercase letters represent the usual
@c  10..35, while lowercase letters represent 36..61.

If @code{base} is 0, then it tries to identify the used base: if the
mantissa begins with the @code{0x} prefix, it assumes that @var{base} is 16.
If it begins with @code{0b}, it assumes that @var{base} is 2. Otherwise, it
assumes it is 10.

It returns a usual ternary value.
If @var{endptr} is not a null pointer, a pointer to the character after
the last character used in the conversion is stored in the location
referenced by @var{endptr}.

in particular a non-zero value is returned if
@var{op} is NaN or Inf, which do not exist in @code{mpf}.

Convert @var{op} to a string of digits in base @var{b}, with rounding in
the direction @var{rnd}. The base may vary from 2 to 36.

The generated string is a fraction, with an implicit radix point immediately
to the left of the first digit.  For example, the number @minus{}3.1416 would
be returned as "@minus{}31416" in the string and 1 written at @var{expptr}.
If @var{rnd} is to nearest, and @var{op} is exactly in the middle of two
possible outputs, the one with an even last digit is chosen
(for an odd base, this may not correspond to an even mantissa).

If @var{n} is zero, the number of digits of the mantissa is chosen
large enough so that re-reading the printed value with the same precision,
assuming both output and input use rounding to nearest, will recover
the original value of @var{op}.
More precisely, the chosen precision is
@ifnottex
1 + ceil(n*log(2)/log(b)).
@end ifnottex
@tex
$1 +
\lceil n {\log 2 \over \log b} \rceil$.
@end tex
This is the minimal precision depending on @var{n} and @var{b} only that
satisfies the above property.

If @var{str} is a null pointer, space for the mantissa is allocated using
the current allocation function, and a pointer to the string is returned.
To free the returned string, you must use @code{mpfr_free_str}.

If @var{str} is not a null pointer, it should point to a block of storage
large enough for the mantissa, i.e., at least @code{max(@var{n} + 2, 7)}.
The extra two bytes are for a possible minus sign, and for the terminating null
character.

If @var{n} is 0, note that the space requirements for @var{str}
in this case will be impossible for the user to predetermine. Therefore,
one needs to pass a null pointer for the string argument whenever
@var{n} is 0.

If the input number is an ordinary number, the exponent is written through
the pointer @var{expptr} (the current minimal exponent for 0).

A pointer to the string is returned, unless there is an error, in which
case a null pointer is returned.
@end deftypefun

@deftypefun void mpfr_free_str (char *@var{str})

Note: These functions may be useful to distinguish the three possible cases.
If you need to distinguish two cases only, it is recommended to use the
predicate functions (e.g., @code{mpfr_equal_p} for the equality) described
below; they behave like the IEEE-754 comparisons, in particular when one
or both arguments are NaN. But only floating-point numbers can be compared

@section Input and Output Functions
@cindex Float input and output functions
@cindex Input functions
@cindex Output functions
@cindex I/O functions

This section describes functions that perform input from an input/output
stream, and functions that output to an input/output stream.
Passing a null pointer for a @var{stream} argument to any of
these functions will make them read from @code{stdin} and write to
@code{stdout}, respectively.

When using any of these functions, you must include the @code{<stdio.h>}
standard header before @file{mpfr.h}, to allow @file{mpfr.h} to define
prototypes for these functions.

@deftypefun size_t mpfr_out_str (FILE *@var{stream}, int @var{base}, size_t @var{n}, mpfr_t @var{op}, mp_rnd_t @var{rnd})
Output @var{op} on stream @var{stream}, as a string of digits in
base @var{base}, rounded in the direction @var{rnd}.
The base may vary from 2 to 36.  Print @var{n} significant digits exactly,
or if @var{n} is 0, enough digits so that @var{op} can be read back
exactly (see @code{mpfr_get_str}).

In addition to the significant digits, a decimal point (defined by the
current locale) at the right of the
first digit and a trailing exponent in base 10, in the form @samp{eNNN},
are printed. If @var{base} is greater than 10, @samp{@@} will be used
instead of @samp{e} as exponent delimiter.

Return the number of bytes written, or if an error occurred, return 0.
@end deftypefun

@deftypefun size_t mpfr_inp_str (mpfr_t @var{rop}, FILE *@var{stream}, int @var{base}, mp_rnd_t @var{rnd})
Input a string in base @var{base} from stream @var{stream},
rounded in the direction @var{rnd}, and put the
read float in @var{rop}.
@c The argument @var{base} must be in the range 2 to 36.

@c The string is of the form @samp{M@@N} or, if the
@c base is 10 or less, alternatively @samp{MeN} or @samp{MEN}, or, if the base
@c is 16, alternatively @samp{MpB} or @samp{MPB}.
@c @samp{M} is the mantissa in the specified base, @samp{N} is the exponent
@c written in decimal for the specified base, and in base 16, @samp{B} is the
@c binary exponent written in decimal (i.e.@: it indicates the power of 2 by
@c which the mantissa is to be scaled).
This function reads a word (defined as a sequence of characters between
whitespace) and parses it using @code{mpfr_set_str} (it may change).
See the documentation of @code{mpfr_strtofr} for a detailed description
of the valid string formats.
@c Special values can be read as follows (the case does not matter):
@c @code{@@NaN@@}, @code{@@Inf@@}, @code{+@@Inf@@} and @code{-@@Inf@@},
@c possibly followed by other characters; if the base is smaller or equal
@c to 16, the following strings are accepted too: @code{NaN}, @code{Inf},
@c @code{+Inf} and @code{-Inf}.

Return the number of bytes read, or if an error occurred, return 0.

@deftypefunx int mpfr_round (mpfr_t @var{rop}, mpfr_t @var{op})
@deftypefunx int mpfr_trunc (mpfr_t @var{rop}, mpfr_t @var{op})
Set @var{rop} to @var{op} rounded to an integer.
@code{mpfr_rint} rounds to the nearest representable integer in the
given rounding mode, @code{mpfr_ceil} rounds
to the next higher or equal representable integer, @code{mpfr_floor} to
the next lower or equal representable integer, @code{mpfr_round} to the
nearest representable integer, rounding halfway cases away from zero,
and @code{mpfr_trunc} to the next representable integer towards zero.

The returned value is zero when the result is exact, positive when it is
greater than the original value of @var{op}, and negative when it is smaller.
More precisely, the returned value is 0 when @var{op} is an integer
representable in @var{rop}, 1 or @minus{}1 when @var{op} is an integer
that is not representable in @var{rop}, 2 or @minus{}2 when @var{op} is
not an integer.

Note that @code{mpfr_round} is different from @code{mpfr_rint} called with
the rounding to the nearest mode (where halfway cases are rounded to an even
integer or mantissa). Note also that no double rounding is performed; for
instance, 4.5 (100.1 in binary) is rounded by @code{mpfr_round} to 4 (100
in binary) in 2-bit precision, though @code{round(4.5)} is equal to 5 and
5 (101 in binary) is rounded to 6 (110 in binary) in 2-bit precision.

Return 0, unless the exponent is not in the current exponent range, in
which case @var{rop} is set to NaN and a non-zero value is returned. The

the interval @minus{}@var{exp} to @var{exp}.
This function is useful for
testing functions and algorithms, since this kind of random numbers have
proven to be more likely to trigger corner-case bugs.
Negative random numbers are generated when @var{size} is negative.
Put +0 in @var{rop} when size if zero. The internal state of the default

and zero otherwise.
If the user changes the exponent range, it is her/his responsibility to check
that all current floating-point variables are in the new allowed range

Return the minimum and maximum of the smallest and largest exponents
allowed for @code{mpfr_set_emin} and @code{mpfr_set_emax}. These values
are implementation dependent; it is possible to create a non
portable program by writing @code{mpfr_set_emax(mpfr_get_emax_max())}

@deftypefun int mpfr_check_range (mpfr_t @var{x}, int @var{t}, mp_rnd_t @var{rnd})
This function forces @var{x} to be in the current range of acceptable
values, @var{t} being the current ternary value: negative if @var{x}
is smaller than the exact value, positive if @var{x} is larger than
the exact value and zero if @var{x} is exact (before the call). It
generates an underflow or an overflow if the exponent of @var{x} is
outside the current allowed range; the value of @var{t} may be used
to avoid a double rounding. This function returns zero if the rounded
result is equal to the exact one, a positive value if the rounded
result is larger than the exact one, a negative value if the rounded
result is smaller than the exact one. Note that unlike most functions,
the result is compared to the exact one, not the input value @var{x},
i.e.@: the ternary value is propagated.
@end deftypefun

@deftypefun int mpfr_subnormalize (mpfr_t @var{x}, int @var{t}, mp_rnd_t @var{rnd})
This function rounds @var{x} emulating subnormal number arithmetic:
if @var{x} is outside the subnormal exponent range, it just propagates the
ternary value @var{t}; otherwise, it rounds @var{x} to precision
@code{EXP(x)-emin+1} according to rounding mode @var{rnd} and previous
ternary value @var{t}, avoiding double rounding problems.
@code{PREC(x)} is not modified by this function.
@var{rnd} and @var{t} must be the used rounding mode for computing @var{x}
and the returned ternary value when computing @var{x}.
The subnormal exponent range is from @code{emin} to @code{emin+PREC(x)-1}.
This functions assumes that @code{emax-emin >= PREC(x)}.
Note that unlike most functions, the result is compared to the exact one,
not the input value @var{x}, i.e.@: the ternary value is propagated.
This is a preliminary interface.

@node Custom Interface, Internals, Compatibility with MPF, MPFR Interface
@section Custom Interface
@cindex Custom Interface

Some applications use a stack to handle the memory and their objects.
However, the MPFR memory design is not well suited for such a thing. So that
such applications are able to use MPFR, an auxiliary memory interface has
been created: the Custom Interface.

The following interface allows them to use MPFR in two ways:
@itemize
@item Either they directly store the MPFR FP number as a @code{mpfr_t}
on the stack.
@item Either they store their own representation of a FP number on the
stack and construct a new temporary @code{mpfr_t} each time it is needed.
@end itemize
Nothing has to be done to destroy the FP numbers except garbaging the used
memory: all the memory stuff (allocating, destroying, garbaging) is kept to
the application.

Each function is this interface is also implemented as a macro for
efficiency reasons.

Note 1: MPFR functions may still initialize temporary FP numbers
using standard mpfr_init. See Custom Allocation (GNU MP).

Note 2: MPFR functions may use the cached functions (mpfr_const_pi for
example), even if they are not explicitly called. You have to call
@code{mpfr_free_cache} each time you garbage the memory iff mpfr_init, through
GMP Custom Allocation, allocates its memory on the application stack.

Note 3: This interface is preliminary.

@deftypefun mp_exp_t mpfr_custom_get_exp (mpfr_t @var{x})
Return the exponent of @var{x}, assuming that @var{x} is a non-zero ordinary
number. The return value for NaN, Infinity or Zero is unspecified but doesn't
produced any trap.
The behavior of this function for any @code{mpfr_t} not initialized
with @code{mpfr_custom_init_set} is undefined.
@end deftypefun

@deftypefun void mpfr_custom_move (mpfr_t @var{x}, void *@var{new_position})
Inform MPFR that the mantissa has moved due to a garbage collect
and update its new position to @code{new_position}.
However the application has to move the mantissa and the @code{mpfr_t} itself.
The behavior of this function for any @code{mpfr_t} not initialized
with @code{mpfr_custom_init_set} is undefined.
@end deftypefun

The following types and
functions were mainly designed for the implementation of @code{mpfr},
but may be useful for users too.
However no upward compatibility is guaranteed.
You may need to include @file{mpfr-impl.h} to use them.

The @code{mpfr_t} type consists of four fields.

@itemize @bullet

@item The @code{_mpfr_prec} field is used to store the precision of
the variable (in bits); this is not less than @code{MPFR_PREC_MIN}.

@item The @code{_mpfr_sign} field is used to store the sign of the variable.

@item The @code{_mpfr_exp} field stores the exponent.
An exponent of 0 means a radix point just above the most significant
limb.  Non-zero values @math{n} are a multiplier @math{2^n} relative to that
point.
A NaN, an Infinity and a Zero are indicated by a special value of the exponent.

@item Finally, the @code{_mpfr_d} is a pointer to the limbs, least
significant limbs stored first.
The number of limbs in use is controlled by @code{_mpfr_prec}, namely
ceil(@code{_mpfr_prec}/@code{mp_bits_per_limb}).
Non-singular values always have the most significant bit of the most
significant limb set to 1.  When the precision does not correspond to a
whole number of limbs, the excess bits at the low end of the data are zero.

@c @deftypefun int mpfr_add_one_ulp (mpfr_t @var{x}, mp_rnd_t @var{rnd})
@c Add one unit in last place (ulp) to @var{x} if @var{x} is finite
@c and positive, subtract one ulp if @var{x} is finite and negative;
@c otherwise, @var{x} is not changed.
@c The return value is zero unless an overflow occurs, in which case the
@c @code{mpfr_add_one_ulp} function behaves like a conventional addition.
@c @end deftypefun

@c @deftypefun int mpfr_sub_one_ulp (mpfr_t @var{x}, mp_rnd_t @var{rnd})
@c Subtract one ulp to @var{x} if @var{x} is finite and positive, add one
@c ulp if @var{x} is finite and negative; otherwise, @var{x} is not changed.
@c The return value is zero unless an underflow occurs, in which case the
@c @code{mpfr_sub_one_ulp} function behaves like a conventional subtraction.
@c @end deftypefun

@deftypefun int mpfr_can_round (mpfr_t @var{b}, mp_exp_t @var{err}, mp_rnd_t @var{rnd1}, mp_rnd_t @var{rnd2}, mp_prec_t @var{prec})
Assuming @var{b} is an approximation of an unknown number
@var{x} in the direction @var{rnd1} with error at most two to the power
E(b)-@var{err} where E(b) is the exponent of @var{b}, return a non-zero
value if one is able to round correctly @var{x} to precision
@var{prec} with the direction @var{rnd2},
and 0 otherwise (including for NaN and Inf).
This function @strong{does not modify} its arguments.
@end deftypefun

@deftypefun double mpfr_get_d1 (mpfr_t @var{op})
Convert @var{op} to a @code{double}, using the default MPFR rounding mode
(see function @code{mpfr_set_default_rounding_mode}). This function is
obsolete.
@end deftypefun


@c @deftypefun void mpfr_set_str_binary (mpfr_t @var{x}, const char *@var{s})
@c Set @var{x} to the value of the binary number in string @var{s}, which has to
@c be of the
@c form +/-xxxx.xxxxxxEyy. The exponent is read in decimal, but is interpreted
@c as the power of two to be multiplied by the mantissa.
@c The mantissa length of @var{s} has to be less or equal to the precision of
@c @var{x}, otherwise an error occurs.
@c If @var{s} starts with @code{N}, it is interpreted as NaN (Not-a-Number);
@c if it starts with @code{I} after the sign, it is interpreted as infinity,
@c with the corresponding sign.
@c @end deftypefun

@c @deftypefun void mpfr_print_binary (mpfr_t @var{float})
@c Output @var{float} on stdout
@c in raw binary format (the exponent is written in decimal, yet).
@c @end deftypefun

The main developers consist of Guillaume Hanrot, Vincent Lef@`evre,
Patrick P@'elissier and Paul Zimmermann.

We would like to thank Jean-Michel Muller and Joris van der Hoeven for very
fruitful discussions at the beginning of that project, Torbj@"orn Granlund
and Kevin Ryde for their help about design issues,
and Nathalie Revol for her careful reading of a previous version of
this documentation.
Kevin Ryde did a tremendous job for the portability of MPFR,
and integrating it into GMP 4.x;
alas the GMP developers decided in January 2004 not to include MPFR any more.

Sylvie Boldo from ENS-Lyon, France,
contributed the functions @code{mpfr_agm} and @code{mpfr_log}.
Emmanuel Jeandel, from ENS-Lyon too,
contributed the generic hypergeometric code in
@code{generic.c}, as well as the @code{mpfr_exp3},
a first implementation of the sine and cosine,
and improved versions of
@code{mpfr_const_log2} and @code{mpfr_const_pi}.
Mathieu Dutour contributed the functions @code{mpfr_atan} and @code{mpfr_asin},
and a previous version of @code{mpfr_gamma};
David Daney contributed the hyperbolic and inverse hyperbolic functions,
the base-2 exponential, and the factorial function. Fabrice Rouillier
contributed the original version of @file{mul_ui.c}, the @file{gmp_op.c}
file, and helped to the Windows porting.
Jean-Luc R@'emy contributed the @code{mpfr_zeta} code.
Ludovic Meunier helped in the design of the @code{mpfr_erf} code.
Damien Stehl@'e contributed the @code{mpfr_get_ld_2exp} function.

The development of the MPFR library would not have been possible without the
continuous support of LORIA, INRIA and INRIA Lorraine.
The development of MPFR was also supported by a grant
(202F0659 00 MPN 121) from the Conseil R@'egional de Lorraine in 2002.
