Probably many bugs.

Known bugs:

* The overflow/underflow exceptions may be badly handled in some functions;
  specially when the intermediary internal results have exponent which 
  exceeds the hardware limit (2^30 for a 32 bits CPU, and 2^62 for a 64 bits 
  CPU).

Potential bugs:

* Possible integer overflows on some machines.

* Possible bugs with huge precisions (> 2^30).

* Possible bugs if the chosen exponent range does not allow to represent
  the range [1/16, 16].

* Possible infinite loop in some functions for particular cases: when
  the exact result is an exactly representable number or the middle of
  consecutive two such numbers (for example, erf).

* The mpfr_set_ld function may be quite slow if the long double type has an
  exponent of more than 15 bits.

* mpfr_set_d may give wrong results on some non-IEEE architectures.

* Error analysis for some functions may be incorrect (out-of-date due
  to modifications in the code?).


Problems due to compiler bugs:

* on some architectures (for example alpha-dec-osf), gcc 3.3 wrongly
  compares "long double" floating-point numbers, with optimization level
  1 or higher. This bug can be detected by the following program:

  #include <stdio.h>
  #include <stdlib.h>
  #include <float.h>
  int
  main ()
  {
    long double d;
    d = 1.0; while (d < LDBL_MAX / 2.0) d += d;
    if (d == (long double) 0.0)
      printf ("d equals 0.0\n");
  }

  This results in a problem in the mpfr_set_ld function. A workaround is
  to compile set_ld.c with -O0 (no optimization).
