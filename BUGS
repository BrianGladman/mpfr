Probably many bugs.

Known bugs:

* The overflows/underflows are not yet implemented in all functions.

* Possible integer overflows on some machines.

* mpfr_set_d may give wrong results on some architectures.

* Error analysis in mpfr_sin is incorrect. Check the other functions too...

* mpfr_hypot fails for very large or very small exponents.
