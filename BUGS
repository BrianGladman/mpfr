Probably many bugs.

Known bugs:

* The overflows/underflows are not yet implemented in all functions.

* Possible integer overflows on some machines.

* mpfr_set_d may give wrong results on some architectures.

* mpfr_hypot may fail for x very large, y very small and a very large
  target precision.
