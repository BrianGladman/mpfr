/* puts the significand of f into z, and returns 'exp' such that f = z * 2^exp
 *
 * 0 doesn't have an exponent, therefore the returned exponent in this case
 * isn't really important. We choose to return __gmpfr_emin because
 *   1) it is in the exponent range [__gmpfr_emin,__gmpfr_emax],
 *   2) the smaller a number is (in absolute value), the smaller its
 *      exponent is. In other words, the f -> exp function is monotonous
 *      on nonnegative numbers. --> This is WRONG since the returned
 *      exponent is not necessarily in the exponent range!
 * Note that this is different from the C function frexp().
