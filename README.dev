Notes for the MPFR developers
=============================

The VERSION file contains the number of the next release version, i.e.
the version currently developed. If nightly snapshots are built, the
date in the yyyymmdd format must be added to the version number, for
instance: "2.0.1-20020319".

To make a release:
  1) Check the version and update the date in mpfr.texi.
  2) Update the ChangeLog file (using rcs2log): rcs2log > ChangeLog.2
     and edit ChangeLog to insert ChangeLog.2 at the beginning and
     remove the duplicated lines.
  3) Generate the release version with "make dist".
  4) Test the release version on different machines, with and without
     the --disable-alloca configure option.
  5) If there is no problem, add a tag to the CVS corresponding to the
     release, e.g. mpfr-2-0-1-rel for mpfr 2.0.1 (note that the periods
     are replaced by dashes): cvs tag mpfr-2-0-1-rel
  6) Update the VERSION file to indicate the next version.
     Update the version in mpfr.texi.

When submitting patches, unified diffs (option -u) are recommended,
as they are more readable. You can also use the option -d to generate
a smaller set of changes. See diff(1) for more information.

Though the ISO C standard requires that <stdlib.h> defines NULL,
do not use NULL with #include <stdlib.h> only, because this will
not work with the native SunOS 4 C compiler, whose headers are
not conform to the standard (even with C90); other problems may
occur on this architecture.

To generate mpfr.info, you need texinfo version 4.2 (or higher).
