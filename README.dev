Notes for the MPFR developers
=============================

The VERSION file contains the number of the next release version, i.e.
the version currently developed. If nightly snapshots are built, the
date in the yyyymmdd format must be added to the version number, for
instance: "2.0.1-20020319".

To make a release:
  1) Update the ChangeLog file (using rcs2log).
  2) Generate the release version with "make dist".
  3) Test the release version on different machines, with and without
     the --disable-alloca configure option.
  4) If there is no problem, add a tag to the CVS corresponding to the
     release, e.g. mpfr-2-0-1-rel for mpfr 2.0.1 (note that the periods
     are replaced by dashes).
  5) Update the VERSION file to indicate the next version.
