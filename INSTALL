		Installing MPFR version 1.0
		===========================

0. You first need to install GMP. See <http://www.swox.com/gmp/>.
   MPFR version 1.0 requires GMP version 3.0 or latter.

   After you have successfully built GMP, and installed it using
   "make install", you'll need to manually install some GMP header 
   files needed by MPFR. In the GMP source directory, type:

   cp config.h gmp-impl.h gmp-mparam.h longlong.h DIR/include

   where DIR is the directory where you have installed GMP.

1. type "./configure --help", to see the options you have to choose
   For most users, "./configure --with-gmp=DIR" will suffice, where
   DIR is the directory where you have installed GMP.

2. type "make" (produces libmpfr.a and tests files)

3. type "make dvi" to produce the documentation (DVI file mpfr.dvi)

4. type "cd tests; make"            4. type "cd tests; make tests"
(produces and runs the test files)  (runs the test files)

Notes:

- we tested the installation with GMP 3.1 on the following architectures:

Pentium II and III/Linux 2.2.10
Alpha 21264 and 21164/OSF1 V4.0
SGI R10000/IRIX 6.5
Sun UltraSparc/Solaris 2.6

./configure options
===================

--with-gmp-include=DIR  assumes that DIR contains mpfr-impl.h, longlong.h...
--with-gmp-lib=DIR      assumes that DIR contains libgmp.a
--with-gmp=DIR          same as --with-gmp-lib=DIR/lib --with-gmp-include=DIR/include

Known problems.
===============

Linux on Alpha is known to have problems with IEEE conformance. See
<http://www.linux.org.uk/VERSION/relnotes.2211.html>.
