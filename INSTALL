		Installing mpfr-0.0
		===================

0. You first need to install GMP. See http://www.swox.com/gmp.

1. run ./Configure and answer to the questions

   (Under Linux use the -DLIBC211 flag if you use the C library 2.1.1 or
    higher.)

2. make (produces libmpfr.a)

3. cd tests; make (produces and runs the test files)

Notes:

- we tested the installation with GMP 2.0.2 on the following architectures:

Pentium II and III/Linux 2.2.10
Alpha 21264/OSF1 V4.0
SGI R10000/IRIX 6.5 (both using 32- and 64-bit limbs)
Sun UltraSparc/Solaris 2.6
HP 9000/HP-UX A.09.05

Known problems.
===============

1) On some architectures (for example Alpha/OSF), the default 'make' command 
crashes in step 3. GNU make is preferred.

2) Under HP-UX, don't use the -pedantic option, otherwise
gcc complains with the longlong.h file from GMP.

3) On the Alpha, the test file for the square root (tsqrt) may produce
errors as follows:

libm.a differs from mpfr_sqrt for a=9.89438396044940260000e-134, rnd_mode=2
libm.a gives 3.14553397063986620000e-67, mpfr_sqrt gives 3.14553397063986680000e-67 (1 ulp)

In most cases, as above, the error comes from the libm.a. On Alpha/Linux,
which is known to have a bad libm.a, you may even find errors in the
addition or multiplication.

In case of problem.

Please contact us at mpfr@loria.fr, indicating the machine and operating
system used (uname -a), the compiler used (gcc -v) and a description of
the problem encountered.
