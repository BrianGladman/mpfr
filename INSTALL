			Installing MPFR
			===============

0. You first need to install GMP. See <http://www.swox.com/gmp/>.
   MPFR requires GMP version 4.0.1 or later.

   After you have successfully built GMP and installed it using
   "make install", you'll need to manually install some GMP header
   files needed by MPFR. In the GMP build directory, type:

     cp config.h gmp-impl.h gmp-mparam.h longlong.h DIR/include

   where DIR is the directory where you have installed GMP, i.e. you
   configured GMP with ./configure --prefix=DIR.

1. In the MPFR build directory, type "./configure --with-gmp=DIR" where
   DIR is the directory where you have installed GMP. If this fails,
   please check that the C compiler and its options are the same than
   those for the GMP build. You can see the later with the following:

     grep "^CC\|^CFLAGS" GMPDIR/Makefile

   where GMPDIR is the GMP build directory, then type (for example,
   under a sh-compatible shell):

     CC=<C compiler> CFLAGS=<compiler options> ./configure --with-gmp=DIR

   Other options can be seen with "./configure --help". For example, if you
   want to install MPFR in /local instead of /usr/local (default), type:

     ./configure --prefix=/local

2. Type "make" (produces libmpfr.a). On some architectures, you should
   provide further options to match those used by GMP, for example, on
   powerpc-aix:

     make AR="ar -X64"

3. Type "make dvi" to produce the documentation (DVI file mpfr.dvi).

4. Type "make check" (produces and runs the test files).

5. Type "make install" (installs the library in /usr/local or in the
   directory given in the --prefix option of configure). You'll probably
   need to be "root" to install MPFR in directories like /usr/local.

./configure options
===================

--prefix=DIR            installs MPFR headers and library in DIR/include
                        and DIR/lib respectively
--with-gmp-include=DIR  assumes that DIR contains gmp-impl.h, longlong.h...
--with-gmp-lib=DIR      assumes that DIR contains libgmp.a
--with-gmp=DIR          same as --with-gmp-lib=DIR/lib --with-gmp-include=DIR/include

Known problems.
===============

See file BUGS for known bugs in MPFR. Some patches may be available on the
MPFR web page <http://www.mpfr.org/> or <http://www.loria.fr/projets/mpfr/>.

* Linux on Alpha is known to have problems with IEEE conformance. See
<http://www.linux.org.uk/VERSION/relnotes.2211.html>. Also with OSF and
gcc 2.8.1, we had problems with the square root functions:

   Testing tsqrt
   libm.a differs from mpfr_sqrt for a=1.72800271916104480000e+210, rnd_mode=GMP_RNDZ
   libm.a gives 1.31453517227993750000e+105, mpfr_sqrt gives 1.31453517227993730000e+105 (-1 ulp)
   maybe you've found a bug in libm.a...
   ### tsqrt failed ###
   Testing tsqrt_ui
   mpfr_sqrt_ui differs from sqrt for a=851401618, rnd_mode=GMP_RNDU
   sqrt gives 2.91787871235251990000e+04, mpfr_sqrt_ui gives 2.91787871235252020000e+04 (1 ulp)
   maybe you've found a bug in libm.a
   ### tsqrt_ui failed ###

(in both cases the mpfr result is the correct one).

* Some tests may fail under IRIX:

   Testing tabs
   Mismatch on d = 2.53345566708801000000e-309
   dd=inf
   0.11101001001011110001110110000010101001101110101010000[00000000000]E-1025
   ### tabs failed ###

   Testing tset_d
   Mismatch on : 1.5131389614080547e-309 != inf
   0.10001011010001011010110011000110010000000101010100000[00000000000]E-1025
   ### tset_d failed ###

   Testing tget_d
   Wrong result for 2^(-1024), got inf instead of 0.00000000000000000000e+00
   ### tget_d failed ###

We do not know yet if this comes from a bug in the test programs or in
the tset_d/tget_d functions.

In case of problem.
===================

Please contact us at mpfr@loria.fr, indicating the machine and operating
system used (uname -a), the compiler and version used (gcc -v if you use
gcc), the version of GMP and MPFR used and a description of the problem
encountered.
