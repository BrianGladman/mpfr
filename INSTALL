			Installing MPFR
			===============

0. You first need to install GMP. See <http://www.swox.com/gmp/>.
   MPFR requires GMP version 4.1 or later.

   MPFR needs some internal GMP header files that are not installed.
   So, keep the GMP build directory as is, at least until you have
   built MPFR.

   The old recommendation was to copy these header files (config.h,
   gmp-impl.h, gmp-mparam.h and longlong.h) to GMPINSTALL/include,
   GMPINSTALL being the directory where you have installed GMP (i.e.
   the directory specified by the --prefix configure option), but
   this method may lead to clashes with other packages. Therefore,
   it should be avoided.

1. In the MPFR build directory, type

     ./configure --with-gmp-include=GMPBUILD --with-gmp-lib=GMPINSTALL/lib

   where GMPBUILD is the GMP build directory and GMPINSTALL the
   directory where you have installed GMP. Because of the internal
   header files required by MPFR, the option --with-gmp=GMPINSTALL
   is not sufficient and should not be used.

   If this fails, please check that the C compiler and its options
   are the same as those for the GMP build. You can see the latter
   with the following:

     grep "^CC\|^CFLAGS" GMPBUILD/Makefile

   Then type (for example, under a sh-compatible shell):

     CC=<C compiler> CFLAGS=<compiler options> ./configure \
       --with-gmp-include=GMPBUILD --with-gmp-lib=GMPINSTALL/lib

   Other options can be seen with "./configure --help". For example, if you
   want to install MPFR in /local instead of /usr/local (default), type:

     ./configure --prefix=/local

2. Type "make" (produces libmpfr.a). On some architectures, you should
   provide further options to match those used by GMP, for example, on
   powerpc-aix:

     make AR="ar -X64"

3. Type "make dvi" to produce the documentation (DVI file mpfr.dvi).

4. Type "make check" (produces and runs the test files).

5. Type "make install" (installs the library in /usr/local or in the
   directory given in the --prefix option of configure). You'll probably
   need to be "root" to install MPFR in directories like /usr/local.

./configure options
===================

--prefix=DIR            installs MPFR headers and library in DIR/include
                        and DIR/lib respectively
--with-gmp-include=DIR  assumes that DIR contains gmp-impl.h, longlong.h...
--with-gmp-lib=DIR      assumes that DIR contains libgmp.a
--with-gmp=DIR          same as --with-gmp-lib=DIR/lib --with-gmp-include=DIR/include

Known problems.
===============

See file BUGS for known bugs in MPFR. Some patches may be available on the
MPFR web page <http://www.mpfr.org/> or <http://www.loria.fr/projets/mpfr/>.

In case of problem.
===================

Please contact us at mpfr@loria.fr, indicating the machine and operating
system used (uname -a), the compiler and version used (gcc -v if you use
gcc), the compile options used if any, the version of GMP and MPFR used
and a description of the problem encountered.

If it is a problem concerning the MPFR compilation or test (i.e. during
configure, make or make check), please send us a log of the installation.
