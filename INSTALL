                        Installing MPFR
                        ===============

0. You first need to install GMP. See <http://www.swox.com/gmp/>.
   MPFR requires GMP version 4.1 or later.

1. Extract the files from the archive.

2. It is strongly advised to apply the latest patches (if this has
   not been done yet), e.g.
     wget http://www.mpfr.org/mpfr-2.3.0/patches
     patch -N -Z -p1 < patches
   or
     curl http://www.mpfr.org/mpfr-2.3.0/patches | patch -N -Z -p1

3. In the MPFR directory, to detect your system, type:
     ./configure

4. To build the library, type:
     make

5. To check the built library (runs the test files), type:
     make check

6. To install it (default "/usr/local" | see "--prefix" option), type:
     make install

If you installed MPFR (header and library) in directories that are
not searched by default by the compiler and/or linking tools, then,
like with other libraries, you may need to set up some environment
variables such as C_INCLUDE_PATH (to find the header mpfr.h),
LIBRARY_PATH (to find the library), and if the shared library has
been installed, LD_LIBRARY_PATH (before execution) or LD_RUN_PATH
(before linking); this list is not exhaustive and some environment
variables may be specific to your system. "make install" gives some
instructions; please read them. You can also find more information
in the manuals of your compiler and linker. The MPFR FAQ may also
give some information.

Remember that if you have several MPFR (or GMP) versions installed
(e.g., one with the system, and one, newer, by you), you will not
necessarily get a compilation/linking error if a wrong library is
used (e.g., because LD_LIBRARY_PATH has not been set correctly).
But unexpected results may occur.

Under Mac OS X, if the shared library was not installed and you use
Apple's linker (this is the default), you will also need to provide
the -search_paths_first linker flag ("-Wl,-search_paths_first" when
you link via gcc) to make sure that the right library is selected,
as by default, Apple's linker selects a shared library preferably,
even when it is farther in the library paths. We recall that if a
wrong library is selected due to this behavior, unexpected results
may occur.


Building the documentation
==========================

To build the documentation in various formats, you may first need to
install recent versions of some utilities such as texinfo.

* Type "make info" to produce the documentation in the info format.

* Type "make dvi" to produce the documentation in the DVI format.

* Type "make mpfr.ps" to produce the documentation in the Postscript format.


Building MPFR with internal GMP header files
============================================

   MPFR built with internal GMP header files is a bit faster,
   so you may want to build it with them. Just do this in step 1:

     ./configure --with-gmp-build=GMPBUILD

   where GMPBUILD is the GMP build directory.
   The needed header files are:
     gmp-impl.h, longlong.h and all the necessary headers to use them.

./configure options
===================

--prefix=DIR            installs MPFR headers and library in DIR/include and
                        DIR/lib respectively (the default is "/usr/local").

--with-gmp-include=DIR  assumes that DIR contains gmp.h [, gmp-impl.h, ...]
--with-gmp-lib=DIR      assumes that DIR contains libgmp.a
--with-gmp-build=DIR    assumes that DIR contains the source of GMP.
                        same as --with-gmp-lib=DIR/.libs
                        and     --with-gmp-include=DIR
                        Try to set CFLAGS to GMP's one.
--with-gmp=DIR          assumes that DIR is where you have installed GMP.
                        same as --with-gmp-lib=DIR/lib
                        and     --with-gmp-include=DIR/include
                        Warning! Do not use these options if you have
                        CPPFLAGS and/or LDFLAGS containing a -I or -L
                        option with a directory that contains a GMP
                        header or library file, as these options just
                        add -I and -L options to CPPFLAGS and LDFLAGS
                        *after* the ones that are currently declared,
                        so that DIR will have a lower precedence.

--enable-assert         build MPFR with assertions.
--enable-thread-safe    build MPFR as thread safe.
--with-irix64           Irix64 support.

Run "./configure --help" to see the other options (autoconf default options).


In case of problem
==================

   If you can, go to the MPFR page for this version, where you could
   find something to solve the problem, or to see if it has already
   been reported:
     http://www.mpfr.org/mpfr-2.3.0/

   If the "configure" fails, please check that the C compiler and its
   options are the same as those for the GMP build (specially the ABI).
   You can see the latter with the following:
     grep "^CC\|^CFLAGS" GMPBUILD/Makefile

   Then type (for example, under a sh-compatible shell):
    ./configure --with-gmp-include=GMPBUILD --with-gmp-lib=GMPINSTALL/lib \
      CC=<C compiler> CFLAGS=<compiler options>
   And continue the install.

   On some architectures, you should provide further options to match
   those used by GMP, for example, on powerpc-aix:
     make AR="ar -X64"

   On some architectures, try with "gmake" (GNU make) instead of "make".
   Problems have been reported with the Tru64 make.

   Try to build MPFR with/without GMP internal files.

   If the build was ok, but the tests failed to link with GMP, it is usually
   because PREFIXDIR/lib is used by the static linker but not by the shared
   linker (where PREFIXDIR is the directory given in --prefix, or /usr/local
   if --prefix wasn't used). There are two solutions:
   1.  setenv LD_LIBRARY_PATH /usr/lib:PREFIXDIR/lib              [csh/tcsh]
    or export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/usr/lib:PREFIXDIR/lib          [bash/zsh/...]
   2. Or run MPFR's configure with "--with-gmp=/usr/local"
    so that libtool is able to fix this problem.

   If you can't solve your problem, you could contact us at <mpfr@loria.fr>,
   indicating the machine and operating system used (uname -a), the compiler
   and version used (gcc -v if you use gcc), the compile options used if any,
   the version of GMP and MPFR used and a description of the problem
   encountered. Please send us also a log of the installation (config.log).

   Note that even if you can build MPFR with a C++ compiler, you can't run
   the test suite: C and C++ are not the same language!
   You should use a C compiler instead.

Notes on Windows 32
===================

1 - We advise to use mingw (http://www.mingw.org/), which is simpler and
    less demanding than Cygwin. Contrary to Cygwin, it also provides native
    windows code. The binaries compiled with Cygwin require a dynamic
    library (cygwin.dll) to work; there is a Cygwin option -mno-cygwin to
    build native code, but it may require some non-portable tricks.

2 - If you just want to make a binary with gcc, there is nothing to do:
    GMP, MPFR and the program compile exactly as under Linux.

3 - If you want to make libraries to work under another Windows compiler
    like Visual C / C++, the "trick" is that the unix-like *.a files created
    by gcc are entirely compatible with the Windows *.lib files. So you just
    have to rename the *.a files into *.lib.

    With gmp-4.1.3, the only remaining problem seems to be the "alloca" calls
    in GMP. Configuring GMP and MPFR with --enable-alloca=malloc-reentrant
    should work (if you build MPFR with GMP internal files).

    Or you could add the library
     "$MINGWIN$/lib/gcc-lib/mingw32/$VERSION$/libgcc.a"
    to your project: it contains all the extra-functions needed by a program
    compiled by gcc (division of 64 bits integer, bcopy, alloca...).
    Of course, include it if and only if your compiler is not gcc.

Notes on Windows 64
===================

MPFR has not been tested on Windows 64.
