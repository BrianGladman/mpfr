How to compile GNU MPFR with mini-gmp
=====================================

(this was tested with MPFR svn 11891 and GMP 6.1.2 on x86_64 GNU/Linux)

1) extract the GMP tarball in say /tmp/gmp-6.1.2
   go into /tmp/gmp-6.1.2/mini-gmp
   gcc -O2 -g -fPIC -c mini-gmp.c
   ar r libgmp.a mini-gmp.o

2) create a GMP install directory in say /tmp
   mkdir /tmp/include
   mkdir /tmp/lib
   cp libgmp.a /tmp/lib
   cp mini-gmp.h /tmp/include/gmp.h

3) extract the MPFR tarball in say /tmp/mpfr
   ./configure --with-gmp=/tmp --enable-mini-gmp

Note: to use this version of the MPFR library, you need to define
the MPFR_USE_MINI_GMP macro before including mpfr.h (alternatively,
you can modify mpfr.h to define this macro at the beginning).
