How to compile GNU MPFR with mini-gmp
=====================================

To build and test MPFR against mini-gmp:

  ./configure --with-mini-gmp=DIR [other configure options]
  make
  make check

"make" will build mini-gmp with the same compiler as for MPFR.

For "make check", tests that use features not supported by mini-gmp
(mpq_t, mpf_t, and the gmp_*printf functions) are skipped.

Note: To use this version of the MPFR library, you need to define
the MPFR_USE_MINI_GMP macro before including mpfr.h (alternatively,
you can modify mpfr.h to define this macro at the beginning). But
this will currently not be usable since mini-gmp.h does not declare
gmp_randstate_t (you need to modify either mini-gmp.h or mpfr.h).

This was tested with MPFR svn r13226 and GMP 6.1.2 on x86_64 GNU/Linux:
