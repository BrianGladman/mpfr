Changes from version 1.0 to version 2001:
- the default installation does not provide any more access to machine 
  rounding mode, and as a consequence does not compare MPFR results with 
  precision=53 to machine results. Add option -DTEST if you want to have
  access to machine rounding mode, and to check MPFR results against.
- the MPFR files do not need <math.h> any more
- the header file <mpfr.h> was split into <mpfr.h> for exported functions
  and <mpfr-impl.h> for internal functions. The user should not use functions
  or macros from <mpfr-impl.h>, since those may change in further releases.
- <mpfr.h> was modified in order to make easy a C++ interface
- MPFR now deals with infinities (+infinity and -infinity) and NaN
- the missing function mpfr_swap is now available
- mpfr_zeta was removed (was incomplete)
- mpfr_init and mpfr_init2 now initialize the corresponding variable to 0
  (like in other initialization functions from GNU MP)
- in case memory allocation fails, an error message is output
- several bugs of version 0.4 were fixed

Changes from version 0.4 to version 1.0:

- Version 1.0 now uses a standard configure/make installation. 
- Version 1.0 implements all functions that are available in the MPF class 
  from GMP 3.1 (except mpf_swap) and a header file mpf2mpfr.h is included in 
  the distribution for easy change from MPF to MPFR. 
- Version 1.0 implements new elementary functions: mpfr_sincos 
- Some functions and macros have been renamed: mpfr_log2 is now 
  mpfr_const_log2, mpfr_pi is now mpfr_const_pi, SIGN is now MPFR_SIGN. 
- Version 1.0 uses faster algorithms for mpfr_exp, mpfr_const_pi, 
  mpfr_const_log2. Compare the timings from version 1.0 and version 0.4. 
- Version 1.0 corrects some bugs of version 0.4. 
- The precision of MPFR variables is now named mpfr_prec, which makes it 
  easier to change it, to say unsigned long long. Same for the rounding mode 
  which is called mp_rnd_t.
