Changes from version 0.4 to version 1.0:

- Version 1.0 now uses a standard configure/make installation. 
- Version 1.0 implements all functions that are available in the MPF class 
  from GMP 3.1 (except mpf_swap) and a header file mpf2mpfr.h is included in 
  the distribution for easy change from MPF to MPFR. 
- Version 1.0 implements new elementary functions: mpfr_sincos 
- Some functions and macros have been renamed: mpfr_log2 is now 
  mpfr_const_log2, mpfr_pi is now mpfr_const_pi, SIGN is now MPFR_SIGN. 
- Version 1.0 uses faster algorithms for mpfr_exp, mpfr_const_pi, 
  mpfr_const_log2. Compare the timings from version 1.0 and version 0.4. 
- Version 1.0 corrects some bugs of version 0.4. 
- The precision of MPFR variables is now named mpfr_prec, which makes it 
  easier to change it, to say unsigned long long. Same for the rounding mode 
  which is called mp_rnd_t.
