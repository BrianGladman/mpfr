/*
  Let q = x/y rounded to the nearest integer (to the nearest even number
  in case x/y = n + 1/2 with n integer).
  Put x - q*y in rem, rounded according to rnd.
  The value stored in *quo has the sign of q, and agrees with q with
  the 2^n low order bits. In other words, *quo = q (mod 2^n) and *quo q >= 0.
  If rem is zero, then it has the sign of x.
  The returned 'int' is the inexact flag giving the place of rem wrt x - q*y.

  If x or y is NaN: *quo is undefined, rem is NaN.
  If x is Inf, whatever y: *quo is undefined, rem is NaN.
  If y is Inf, x not NaN nor Inf: *quo is 0, rem is x.
  If y is 0, whatever x: *quo is undefined, rem is NaN.
  If x is 0, whatever y (not NaN nor 0): *quo is 0, rem is x.

  Otherwise if x and y are neither NaN, Inf nor 0, q is always defined,
  thus *quo is.
  Since |x - q*y| <= y/2, no overflow is possible.
  Only an underflow is possible when y is very small.
